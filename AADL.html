							<h2>Project Introduction</h2>
							<p>In this project, we identified the root causes of existing problems of tickets intake system and make recommendations for The Ann Arbor District Library (AADL).
							In order to assist the AADL in responding to and managing requests coming through the current entry channels more cohesively and systematically, our team conducted six interviews and based on these, put forwards three recommendations.</p>

							<h2>The Problem</h2>
							<p>The Ann Arbor District Library (AADL) has four channels for patrons to make requests: the askus@aadl.org email account, a text message service, the ‘contact us’ page on the AADL’s official website, and social media accounts like Facebook and Twitter. Due to a lack of a systematic method in responding to these requests, staff members tend to use different approaches to replying to tickets, based on the contents of the message and their own departmental customs, leading to incomplete records on the AADL’s end.</p>
							<h2>The Process</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/AADL_process.png" alt="" /></span>
							
							<h2>Contextual Inquiry</h2>
							<h3>Observations & interviews</h3>
							<p>In order to learn more about how AADL staff uses the ticketing system, we scheduled interviews with six employees. The employees were suggested by deputy director Eli Neiberger as users who interact with the system in a variety of different ways, and spanned roles from leadership to librarian to support staff. During the interviews, we observed the participants as they worked on answering these tickets or walked us through some recent tickets they had answered, taking note of both what participants said and how participants interacted with the system.</p>
							<h3>Interview data interpretation</h3>
							<p>In order to see the commonalities between interviews and pick out the overarching problems. We typed up our handwritten notes after each interview was over. After the last interview, we took all of these notes and created an ‘affinity wall’ by grouping like notes together.</p>

							<h2>Identify Problems</h2>
							<p><i><b>“A good question is half of the answer”</i></b></br>Identifying key problems for the current ticketing system helped us ask the right questions be able to provide viable solutions. The problems we found include:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>The dropdown menus on “Contact Us” are unclear, meaning staff get tickets that do not actually fall within their purview and that need to be rerouted</li>
								<li>The dropdown menus in the database (for staff) are out of date, containing locations or programs that no longer exist</li>
								<li>Some staff prefer to work exclusively over email, which makes the records in the database incomplete and leaves tickets open in the database</li>
								<li>Staff respond through email or do not publish answers to very specific questions even if they are working in the database, impacting the library’s goal of transparency</li>
								<li>Too much email is generated through this system</li>
								<li>Tickets cannot be rerouted to individual staff members in the database, though many staff would like to refer tickets to specific staff</li>
								<li>Staff need a more efficient way to check/track rerouted tickets</li>
								<li>Staff have a hard time searching for old tickets in both their email and the database</li>
								<li>There are too many required fields in the database to fill out for patrons</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Brainstorming</h2>
							<p>The biggest takeway: Don’t be afraid of being silly.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/AADL_brain.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>We generated ideas based on each key problem we identified. The potential solutions include:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Add additional email functions ('close' and 'publish')</li>
								<li>Stop email notifications & force people to use database</li>
								<li>Recreate 'contact us' page--include descriptions, eliminate dropdown</li>
								<li>Redesign back end of database (route to individuals, cutting down number of fields)</li>
								<li>Add new position that is solely receiving/tracking/answering tickets</li>
								<li>Develop a new software for ideal use</li>
								<li>New piece of CRM or help-desk software</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Evaluation</h2>
							<h3>Evaluation for Potential Solutions</h3>
							<p>We evaluated and ranked each potential solution by the flowing criteria so that we could find the most cost-effective solution:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Financial cost</li>
								<li>Time cost</li>
								<li>Fit with current use</li>
								<li>Overall ease of user experience</li>
								<li>Number of problems solved</li>
							</ul>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/AADL_table.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<h2>The Recommendations</h2>
							<h3><i>1. Altering the current system</i></h3>
							<p>Our first set of recommendations focuses on altering the current system, rather than starting with something new entirely due to our finding that most people believe this system is successful in its ultimate goal of meeting patron needs. Therefore, we have come up with several ways to alter the existing system. These solutions are generally low-effort, and address the main issues that we identified. They could all be implemented together to greater effect.</p>
						
								<h3>Redesigning the back end of the database to cut down unnecessary data fields.</br>Add in an additional field which allows users to search and reroute tickets to specific people.</h3>
							<div class="columns project-intro">
								<div class="caption caption-1">
									<img src="images/AADL_database_new.png" alt="description"></img>
									<p>This screenshot shows the new system to see the ticket information. We removed certain  elds about the patron and added the option to transfer the ticket to a specific person.</p>

									<p>This screenshot shows the new design list of tickets. The only difference is that added feature of searching for specific tickets based on keywords and dates.</p>

							</div>
							
							<h3>Embedding a call-to-action button in the email interface so staff members will be able to close or publish the tickets from their email.</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/AADL_email.png" alt="" /></span>
							
							<h3>Adding descriptions of each request type on the contact us page.</h3>

							<div class="caption caption-1">
									<img src="images/AADL_contactlist.png" alt="description"></img>
									<p>The additional contact list mockup.</p>
							</div>


							<h3><i>2. Using Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software</i></h3>
							<p>Given the AADL’s needs, we recommend 4 CRM software which provide features such as assigning a task to a specific team member, tracking ticket progress in real-time, saving responses for frequently asked questions, tagging and collaborating with other team members, and live chat.</p>

							<h3><i>3. Creating a completely new piece of software</i></h3>
							<p>This solution would solve the issues of too much email clutter, a poor backend system that is difficult to use, and the many different channels of communication. This recommendation could be implemented together with other solutions such as redesigning the "Contact Us" page to improve both patrons’ and staff members’ using experience.</p>

							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<h3>Limitation</h3>
							<p>There are some limitations in this project. First, our team failed to conduct most of our interviews in the interviewee’s workplaces due to restrictions such as the limited physical space of participants’ workplaces. Additionally, though our team conducted our interviews with six AADL staff members of various job responsibilities, most of them had administrative roles. More librarians should have been involved in the interviews so that we had more diverse use cases to look at when making our recommendations. Finally, we did not interview any AADL patrons about their experience of using the current “contact us” system. Instead, we got data about the problems patrons might face from the AADL staff we interviewed.</p>
							<h3>The Biggest Takeaway</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>Always try to find a cost-effective solution</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Although redesigning the whole ticketing system would solve all the problems, we should always try to tackle with the problem from the root cause, and think about using small changes to make big difference.</p>
							<h3>What I would do differently?</h3>
							<p>The scope of this course focused on the context inquiry skills instead of usability testing or user research. If time and budget allowed, I would recruit 15 users to perform card sorting to make sure the categories and terminologies on the “Contact Us” page are clear to patrons.</p>
